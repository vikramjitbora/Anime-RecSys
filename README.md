# Anime Recommendation System (WIP)

This is an **end-to-end Machine Learning project** focused on building a **Recommendation System for Anime** lovers.  
The project is currently a **Work In Progress (WIP)** and involves **data ingestion, model development, deployment**, and **CI/CD setup**.

---

## ✨ Features (current stage)

- **Data Ingestion and Storage**:  
  - Using **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** for storing and managing the anime dataset.
  
- **Model Development and Validation**:  
  - Built using **TensorFlow** and **Python**.
  - Model designed to recommend anime based on user preferences.

- **Deployment**:  
  - **Flask** application to serve the model via REST API.
